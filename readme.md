# Similar Products API - Spring Boot

##  Overview

This project is a **Spring Boot REST API** that finds similar products based on a given product ID. The implementation follows:
 
- **Spring Boot with OpenAPI documentation**
- **Feign Client to connect with external services**
- **Metrics collection using Prometheus & Grafana**
- **Automated tests**

##  Features

- **Get similar products** using REST API (`GET /product/{productId}/similar`)
- **Handles errors** for missing products and server issues
- **OpenAPI documentation** with Swagger UI
- **Uses Feign Client** to fetch product data
- **Includes unit tests** for API and service
- **Collects metrics with** Prometheus and sends them to Grafana

## Automated Tests

This project follows TDD principles and includes automated tests to ensure reliability and stability:

- **Unit Tests**: Validates individual components using JUnit & Mockito.

- **Controller Tests**: Uses MockMvc to simulate API requests and validate responses.

- **Service Tests**: Ensures business logic correctness by mocking external dependencies.

##  How to Run

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Run with Docker

```sh
docker-compose up --build
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ API Documentation

Swagger UI: [http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:5000/swagger-ui.html)

##  API Endpoints

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Get Similar Products**

**Endpoint:** `GET /product/{productId}/similar`

| Response Code | Description              |
| ------------- | ------------------------ |
| 200           | Returns similar products |
| 404           | Product not found        |
| 500           | Internal server error    |

### Metrics Monitoring with Prometheus & Grafana

This project includes metrics collection using Micrometer & Prometheus, sending data to Grafana for visualization.

- **Prometheus scrapes metrics from** http://localhost:5000/actuator/prometheus

- **Grafana visualizes metrics from Prometheus**

- **Dashboards include HTTP requests, CPU, memory, and JVM metrics**

## Ô∏èTechnologies Used
- **Java 21**
- **Spring Boot** (REST API)
- **Feign Client** (External API calls)
- **JUnit5 & Mockito** (Testing)
- **OpenAPI/Swagger** (API Documentation)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (Containerization)
- **Gradle** (Dependency Management)

## üîç Important

This project follows the same folder structure and Docker Compose setup as the base challenge. It is designed to run inside the same Docker network as the other services.
‚ùó I don't know why, but on my PC, the configuration to use an external Docker network to merge with the existing Docker Compose setup was not working well. Because of this, I placed this service inside the same folder structure as the base Compose setup to ensure it runs within the correct network.
